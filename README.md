# Pawtastic React.js Single Page App

A React.js front-end application which contains the UI for Pawtastic which was based on the designs sent to me via email.




## Installation

Install the dependencies by running npm install

```bash
  cd pawtastic-frontend-app
  
  npm install
```

    
## Run Locally

Before running this project, make sure you're running the pawtastic-backend-api project at the same time.

You can check the AppointmentForm.js file to see if the port being used in the Axios request is the same as what the Laravel backend is using.

When you're all good, run

```bash
  npm start
```

Now the project should be accessible at: localhost:3000
